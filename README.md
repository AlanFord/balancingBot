# balancingBot
my version of a balancing robot


This is a fork of the balancing robot design documented at http://www.brokking.net/yabr_main.html
I'm replacing most parts with easier-to-obtain breakout boards from sparkfun.com, pololu.com, and amazon.com.
Also, the carrier board will be a pcb with 0-ohm jumpers on many pins.
