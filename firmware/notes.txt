Changes from the original design:
1) Using SPI to communicate with the wireless card.  This will require use of arduino
	pins D10, D11, D12, and D13.
2) Need to solder up another LED.  The on-board LED is attached to the ATMEGA328 pin 17 
	(PB5) (SCK), which is wired to pin 9 of JP6.  This appears to be labeled on the 
	Arduino Pro Mini board as D13.
3) The voltage divider was redone, so the constants in the code should be altered.
4) Serial to the PC may be available since the wireless link isn't using it.
